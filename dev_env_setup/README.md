Development environment setup
===============

The first time i tried to compile/generate a fpdb package, i fought for hours with finding and installing all the required dependencies.
Thanks to the help of @philroberts, i finally managed to get my development environment ready.

In order to ease newcomers to contribute to this great project, i thought that providing a way of configuring a working development environment would be worthwhile.

Available environment targets

* /win64: Windows 7 x64
* to be created

Goal ?
----

Starting from freshly installed OS, user shall be able to:

1. Execute the setup script corresponding to their OS, following setup steps
2. Generate a working fpdb package using the build script at the root of the repository
